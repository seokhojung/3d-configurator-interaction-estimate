title: Template Update/Delete + RLS
decision: PASS
rationale: |
  Owner-only update/delete implemented with clear error contract and priority
  ordering. Unit/integration tests cover 401/404/403/422/400/200/204 branches.
evidence:
  unit: npm run test:unit (passed)
  integration: npm run test:integration (passed)
risks:
  - In-memory store placeholder (Supabase integration pending in FR2)
  - Audit logging/history not implemented (non-blocking)
recommendations:
  - Preserve error contract and RLS rules when integrating Supabase
  - Consider audit logging and updated_at in follow-up stories
